## Description

This weather app was intellectually stimulating as it had me try and complete working with API's. The connection to the API's is working however the other primary functionalities of saving search results is not created yet. The weather does connect to cities and provides results for certain climate attributes and a forcast for 5 days. 

My plans consist of updating to match the full mock up later in my bootcamp.
